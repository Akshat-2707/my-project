LIVE CHARACTER COUNTER

FIELD: Textarea (Typing Box)
Requirement: This is the box where the user can type anything.
Working: As soon as we start typing, it will count the number of characters and show them below.
VALID INPUTS:

"Hello" → Shows 5

"12345" → Shows 5

"Hi there!" → Shows 9
INVALID INPUTS:

None, because all types of characters are allowed (letters, numbers, symbols).

FIELD: Character Counter (Display Part)
Requirement: It shows how many characters are typed inside the textarea.
Working: The value changes immediately whenever we add or remove any character.
VALID OUTPUTS:

Typing "abc" → Characters: 3

Typing "Good Morning" → Characters: 12

Empty box → Characters: 0

SCRIPT (JavaScript Code)

The script is used to update the character count live.

It works using the input event which runs every time we type, delete, paste, or cut text.

Main logic: take the length of the text and show it in the <span> tag.

FORM SUBMISSION

The only purpose is to show the live character count.
