This code is a small project that combines JavaScript classes and React. It mainly focuses on how we can use inheritance to create reusable and well-structured code.

Person Class:

This is the base class.

It has two properties: name and age.

Both students and teachers have these common features, so they are written only once in the Person class.

Student Class:

This class extends (inherits from) Person.

Along with name and age, it also has an extra property called course.

So every student object will store which course they are enrolled in.

Teacher Class:

This class also extends Person.

It adds a new property called subject.

So every teacher object will store which subject they teach.

React App Component:

Inside the App function, one object of Student and one object of Teacher are created.

Example: Student('Student', 20, 'Course') and Teacher('Teacher', 35, 'Subject').

These objects hold data, which is then shown on the screen.

The JSX (HTML-like code in React) is used to display student info (name, age, course) and teacher info (name, age, subject) in a neat format.

Output:

When the project runs, it shows a heading “Person Class Hierarchy”.

Below that, it displays the student’s details and the teacher’s details separately.

This makes it easy to understand how the data from objects created using classes is being displayed in a React application.

In summary:
This code is a simple demonstration of object-oriented programming with inheritance in JavaScript and how the created objects can be displayed inside a React UI. It helps to understand both class relationships and React rendering in a practical way.
